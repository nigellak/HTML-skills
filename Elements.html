An HTML element usually consists of a start tag and an end tag, with the content inserted in between:

<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>

The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag.<br>

HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.
Empty elements do not have an end tag, such as the <br> element (which indicates a line break).
Empty elements can be "closed" in the opening tag like this: <br />.

HTML elements can be nested (elements can contain elements).

All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.

HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.
